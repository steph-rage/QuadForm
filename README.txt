# Quadratic Formula Solver

A simple program to find the complex solutions of any given quadratic (something of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0)

## Getting Started

This program just uses Python 2.7, so that's all you need to have installed on your machine!

## Running

Simply install the program and then run it from the command line by typing: python QuadForm.py
The program will ask you for three inputs, the a, b, and c. These correspond to the numbers in front of your x^2, x and the constant. Type these in and you will be given the solutions to you equation!
